FF ROSTER
=========

Gives an optimized FF roster for auction sytle systems.
Uses the greedy algorithm to sovle the knapsack problem - essentially we put the best-valued players in first.

Runs other constraints on the playerlist. Eg; my players can't have criminal records, can't be already taken, etc.
