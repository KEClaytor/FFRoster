FF ROSTER
=========

Gives an optimized FF roster for auction sytle systems.
Uses the greedy algorithm to sovle the knapsack problem - essentially we put the best-valued players in first.

Runs other constraints on the playerlist. Eg; my players can't have criminal records, can't be already taken, etc.

I don't think this is a particularly good way of getting a FF roster, but it was fun to implement.

==========
How to use
==========
The program first pulls data from the web / files.
'python getPoliceBlotter.py
python getPlayerLists.py'
will run these. The second pulls player FF points values / costs from files that look like costSSS.dat or ptsSS.dat
They pickle the outputs in .pk files.

Next MakeGreedyRoster can be run.
'python MakeGreedyRoster.py'
This will find the best value (points/cost) players and then add those to your team until the budget (mycash) is reached.

To update while you're doing the auction;
Add player names from those who were purchased to the file purchased.dat
Add player names, position, and the $ you paid (tab separated) to the file myteam.dat.

I found it useful to have the full list of players, to decide if I wanted to bid on them / how much. If others nominated them. This appears above your team purchase suggestion.
